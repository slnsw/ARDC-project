      "Joseph Banks was born in London on 13 February 1743. He was educated at Harrow and Eton Schools and Oxford University. In 1767 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society. In 1778 he was elected President of the Royal Society, a position which he held until his death in 1820. \n",
      "He successfully lobbied the Royal Society to be included on James Cook's first Pacific voyage on board the Endeavour (1768-1771). Following his return from the Pacific, Banks was actively involved in almost every aspect of Pacific exploration and early Australian colonial life. He actively supported the proposal of Botany Bay in New South Wales as a site for British settlement, founded on 26 January 1788. He corresponded with the early governors of New South Wales and recommended William Bligh to succeed Philip Gidley King as fourth Governor. \n",
      "Banks sent botanists to all parts of the known world, often at his own expense. He organised the breadfruit voyages under the command of William Bligh (1787-1789 and 1791-1793), as well as Matthew Flinders voyage on the Investigator (1801-1803).\n",
      "Banks was created a baronet in 1781 and invested Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath in 1795. In March 1779 he married Dorothea Hugessen (1758-1828). They had no children. Sir Joseph Banks died on 19 June 1820.\n",
      "\n",
